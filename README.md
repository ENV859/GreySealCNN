# Seal Detection using CNNs

Repo using RetinaNet for seal detection in drone imagery along with a set of tools for using geospatial data with CNNs. All operations are executed Google Colab: for each script, if you are viewing in GitHub or locally in Jupyter Notebook, click the "launch in Google Colab" button at the top to launch the script in Google Colab instead. If you clone or fork this project be sure to update those pointer buttons in the markdown to link to your new version.

Each script pulls in files from a Google Drive folder <b> that you must specify </b> and spits out files that will download in your browser as a zip archive that you must extract. When you move on to the next script <b> you must put these files into a Google Drive folder and point the next script to that folder </b>. It doesn't have to be the same drive folder, but it can be.

Pay attention to the markdown at the start of each script, which specifies what's needed to run the script. The markdown at the end of each script explains what's ahead, and how the outputs fit together in the next steps.
